However, instead of creating entire R/Shiny applications, DaVinci provides individual modules. Modules are functional building blocks that can be linked together into customized apps. This customization enables App Creators to build their own app according to trial-specific needs without deep R knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\nDaVinci software development including the codebase will be made fully open-source, which will allow you to use or co-develop DaVinci.\nOur initial open-source release is planned by Q3-2024!\nDon’t miss our release and other DaVinci related news, and join the DaVinci LinkedIn group today!"
